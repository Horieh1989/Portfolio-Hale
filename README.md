# My Personal Portfolio

A multi‑page personal portfolio website built to present who I am, showcase my skills, highlight my projects, and provide an easy way to contact me. This project demonstrates my front‑end development abilities using HTML, CSS, SCSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on clean structure and responsive design.

### 1. About Me
An introduction to who I am, my background, and my goals.
